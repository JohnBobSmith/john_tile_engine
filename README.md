# John's Tiling Engine
Welcome to the repository for John's Tiling Engine, or JTE.

Backstory:
I was very frustrated with the lack of a proper tiling engine 
for 2D video games. A lot of excellent game engines/framework also
lack a scene graph, something I will be impleneting shortly.
I also dislike the fact that there are no decent world/map editors.
I may implement one of those too. We'll see, but lets not get ahead 
of ourselves. This specific project aims to be a simple and awesome way to
get started with making 2D levels. It is not meant to be a complete
game engine at this time.

To compile this, you will need:
SFML >= 2.3.2-4
A C++ compiler
And currently, a Linux based OS. I will not support Windows OS at this time. 

I may write a makefile to make this easier in the future, we'll see. 

Enjoy!
