# John's Tiling Engine
Welcome to the repository for John's Tiling Engine, or JTE.

Backstory:
I was very frustrated with the lack of a proper tiling engine support
for 2D video games. So I've decided to make a simple tiling engine myself. 

To compile this, you will need:

SFML >= 2.3.2-4

A C++ compiler

And currently, a Linux based OS. I will not support Windows OS at this time. 

As of 2017/07/30, a Makefile has been added to src/ for your use. Note that the Makefile is
a constant work in progress!

Enjoy using JTE! :)

Special thanks to anyone who has helped me with this project. You know who you are. :)
