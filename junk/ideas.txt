For any/all of my ideas and digital brainstorming...
Making this public to show others my thought process,
maybe get feedback or other ideas who knows. :) 

The Adventures of Ironville - Idea one:
-You are a piece of iron ore, travelling along in a railcar.
-move the car left/right/up to avoid obstacles and make it 
to the refinery safely! 
-Spill too much raw iron and you lose
-crash the car, fall of edge, etc. and you lose.
-Maybe you can change the track that you're on at specific junctions??
-The more ore you refine at the end of each level, the more refined ore 
currency, RO, you have.
-refined ore will allow you to buy/upgrade your rail car
	-more cars?
	-weapons??
	-speed
	-Better wheels IE make it harder to de-rail
	-Lower ore loss threshold (lose more ore before losing game)
	-More refined ore currency per load IE ore is worth more. 

-Obstacles include:
	-Terrain. Steeper hills, bumpy/broken track sections, stop 
	plates/bumbers or concrete blocks to be hopped over, closed rail 
	gates, and what not
	-Moving obstacles. Other rail cars, animals, spilled ore...
	-Sections which perhaps require speeding up and slowing down 
	suddenly, thereby increasing chance of dumping ore/derailing.

-Puzzles might include:
	-Overly complex ones like: 
	Many switches, color coded, which must be turned to the correct 
	setting before the ore refinery at the end of each level will 
	open. For example, pull lever one to turn button one orange, and 
        lever two to make button two blue. This matches a pattern found 
	by the player, and opens the door. 
		-Players will be able to find puzzle fragments 
		thorughout the level, and finding all fragments gives 
		them the color map needed to open the ore refinery.
			-These fragments themselves are then, of course, 
			hidden somewhere in the level
	
	-Using the mouse to control stuf. IE turning and hold a gate 
	open while the train passes underneath, or drag+drop animals
	out of the way.
